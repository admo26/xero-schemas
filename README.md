# xero-schemas
Machine generated, machine-readable schemas for the Xero APIs

These schemas are currently being used in the `2.0` branch 

## APIs supported
* Accounting API
* Payroll API (AU)
* Payroll API (US)
* Files API
* Assets API

The generated OpenAPI/Swagger files in the `schemas` folder.


## OAuth 1.0

Unfortunately, the spec doesn't allow OAuth1, so there's not quite enough in the schemas to make a fully generatable API.
